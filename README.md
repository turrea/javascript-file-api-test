# Javascript Test
Javascript test to create in memory file api. The instructions were:

Using JavaScript, create a simple file system API (in-memory) for creating, reading, moving, and deleting files and folders. Methods should be able to operate on more than item at a time. The API should emulate the asynchronous nature of an external over-the-network API, using Promises[1] or a similar pattern.
